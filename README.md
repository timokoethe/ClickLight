# ClickLight

ClickLight is a macOS menu bar app that highlights your clicks during live demos, so viewers can see exactly when you pressed even if the UI responds slowly.

## Demo

## Install

Install with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap aurorascharff/clicklight https://github.com/aurorascharff/ClickLight
brew install --cask aurorascharff/clicklight/clicklight
```

Homebrew install will work after the first signed release is published. Until then, or if you prefer building from source, use [Manual Install](docs/MANUAL_INSTALL.md).

## Features

- Click highlights across macOS apps
- Separate visuals for press, release, right-click, and drag
- Menu-bar controls for size, duration, and intensity
- Test pulse for verifying overlay behavior
- Native Swift/AppKit app
- No Xcode project required

## Permissions

ClickLight requires Accessibility permission to detect clicks outside its own menu-bar app. You will be prompted on first launch, or grant it manually in:

**System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility**

After enabling permission, quit ClickLight from the menu bar and reopen it.

## Modify It

ClickLight is personal software: one small presentation annoyance, fixed directly. The project is intentionally small so you or an agent can change it without much ceremony.

## Releasing
