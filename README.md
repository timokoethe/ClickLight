# ClickLight

ClickLight is a tiny native macOS menu-bar app for live coding demos. It highlights mouse clicks anywhere on your Mac so viewers can see exactly when you pressed, released, right-clicked, or dragged.

It was built for the common demo problem where your physical click happens slightly before the UI changes on screen.

## Features

- Global click highlighting across macOS apps, including browsers and editors
- Separate visuals for press, release, right-click, and drag
- Menu-bar controls for size, intensity, duration, and event types
- Transparent overlay windows for each display
- Accessibility permission flow for global mouse capture
- No Xcode project required

## Requirements

- macOS 14 or newer
- Apple Swift toolchain / Command Line Tools

You can check Swift availability with:

```bash
swift --version
```

## Build And Run

From the project root:

```bash
chmod +x build-app.sh
./build-app.sh
open ClickLight.app
```

The build script compiles the Swift package in release mode and creates `ClickLight.app` in the project folder.

On first launch, macOS may ask for Accessibility access. If clicks do not show highlights, open:

```text
System Settings -> Privacy & Security -> Accessibility
```

Then enable `ClickLight`, quit the app from the menu bar, and reopen it.

## How It Works

ClickLight is a native Swift/AppKit app. It uses:

- `CGEventTap` for low-level global mouse events
- `NSEvent.addGlobalMonitorForEvents` as a fallback capture path
- transparent borderless `NSWindow` overlays on each screen
- AppKit drawing for the pulse animations
- `NSStatusItem` for the menu-bar controls
