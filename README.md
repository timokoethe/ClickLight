# ClickLight

ClickLight is a tiny native macOS menu-bar app for live coding demos. It highlights clicks anywhere on your Mac so viewers can see when you actually pressed, even if the UI responds slowly.

It is personal software: one small presentation annoyance, fixed directly.

## Demo

## What It Does

- shows click highlights across macOS apps
- distinguishes press, release, right-click, and drag
- lets you tune size, duration, and intensity from the menu bar
- works as a local Swift/AppKit app, no Xcode project required

## Install

ClickLight does not have a packaged installer yet. Build it locally, copy the app into Applications, then grant Accessibility permission:

[Installation](docs/INSTALLATION.md)

## Modify It

The project is intentionally small so you or an agent can change it without much ceremony:

[Local Development](docs/LOCAL_DEVELOPMENT.md)

The short version:

```bash
./build-app.sh
open ClickLight.app
```

## How It Is Built

ClickLight is a Swift Package Manager executable wrapped into a macOS `.app` bundle by `build-app.sh`.
